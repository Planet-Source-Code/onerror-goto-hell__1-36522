## OnError goto hell


</div>

### Description

If the user don't know why use on error, well...

forget this code.

comments, please!

This program read your project(.vbp) insert ON ERROR in every procedure and save it back. Never more forget one piece of code unprotected.

And if some error happen after this, the new code save the error number, place in the code & text into one LOGFile. It save the screen too. This can help you to find the reason of the problem and kill it.

You MUST return some value in FUNCTIONS.

So, the program add one reminder to you into the new protected code.

I can't guess what you wanna return in each FUNCTION.

Do what you think is better for the returned value.
